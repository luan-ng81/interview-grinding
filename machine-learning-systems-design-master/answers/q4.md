# Answer to question 4

**Question 4**

For any user on Twitter, how would you suggest who they should follow? What do you do when that user is new? What are some of the limitations of data-driven recommender systems?

*** Q1: how would you suggest who they should follow?
***************************************************************************************************************************************


Approach 1: Use Graph-based recommendations: 
Because there are many different types of users acrossn  different contexts and on different clients, the actual algorithms deployed in production tend to be ensembles that integrate results from different approaches.

Note: Users may be segmented so that different segments group will have different recommendation. 

Main approaches: 

1) Circle of Trust (Personalized PageRank):  identifies influential and relevant accounts by performing random walks over the user’s network.

Pros: Highly personalized, adapts to user preferences

Cons: Needs graph traversal, can be computationally expensive


2) SALSA Algorithm (Stochastic Approach for Link-Structure Analysis)
Idea: create hubs (users from circle of trust) and authorities (users those hubs follow), then do two-step random walk between hub and authorities to get most ranked connections. 

Pros: Balances similarity and diversity, great for new users

Cons: More complex than basic PageRank


3) Most Common Neighbors Algorithm: to find supernodes from connections of users that you follow. Based on fixed rule (counting), different from stochastic natures of (1) & (2)

Pros: Simple, fast, works well for popular accounts

Cons: Less personalized, can over-suggest influencers


4) Closure: A -> B, B-> C, C-> A then C is recommended for A. 

Pros: Reinforces strong relationships, promotes engagement

Cons: Limited to existing network structure, not useful for new users


Observations: 

To evaluate which recommendation method performs best, Twitter:
	•	Conducts A/B testing by showing different users different recommendation strategies.
	•	Measures Follow-Through Rate (FTR) = (Follows from recommendations) ÷ (Total recommendations shown).
	•	Uses Engagement Per Impression (EPI) = How much a user interacts with recommended accounts after following them.

Results from Evaluation
	•	SALSA and Personalized PageRank performed best in terms of engagement and relevance.
	•	Most Common Neighbors had higher follow rates, but many follows were low-quality (users unfollowed them later).
	•	Triadic Closure had high engagement rates, but low scalability.

Approach 2:  learns from historical user behavior, the goal is to predict which recommendations will lead to engagement.
Use the following features: 

 - Graph-Based Features:	Mutual followers, Common neighbors, SALSA score
 - Engagement Features: 	Retweets, Likes, Replies between users
 - User Behavior: 	How often the user follows recommendations
 - Content Similarity: 	Similar tweets, Shared hashtags, NLP-based embedding similarity 
 - Recency Features: 	When the last interaction occurred
 - Social Proof: 	How many mutual friends follow the user

=) 1) Binary Classification (Follow vs. Not Follow)
   2) Multi-class, multi label recommendation  
   3) Ranking problem (learning to rank): the model ranks potential accounts based on how relevant they are to the user. (Pairwise Loss, Listwise Loss)
   4) Link Prediction (Graph-Based Approach): Model Twitter as a graph  G = (U, E) , where users are nodes and follows are edges. Predict missing edges (i.e., suggest new follows).
   5) Reinforcement Learning (Exploration vs. Exploitation): Frame the problem as a sequential decision-making task, where the system dynamically updates recommendations based on user feedback (follows or ignores).

 Q2: What do you do when that user is new?
***************************************************************************************************************************************


	•	When a new user signs up, batch-generated recommendations are not yet available. Instead, the real-time system:
	1.	Looks at the new user’s activity (e.g., first follows, likes, tweets).
	2.	Finds similar users using a real-time graph traversal.
	3.	Generates recommendations instantly, based on trending and popular users.

Example: If a user follows @NBA, the system immediately suggests @Lakers, @ESPN, etc.


Use the following approaches to gather more info: 

•	Onboarding Questions: New users are prompted to select topics of interest and follow some initial accounts.
•	Trending Topics & Popular Tweets: The system shows popular tweets based on location or global trends to keep users engaged.
•	Lookalike User Matching: Twitter clusters new users based on demographic data, device type, or early actions (e.g., following a few accounts) to recommend content that similar users engage with.
•	Cross-Domain Signals: If users sign up via Google, Apple, or Facebook, Twitter may infer interests from those connections.

 Q3: What are some of the limitations of data-driven recommender systems?
***************************************************************************************************************************************

1)  Cold start problem: limited data
=> follow up solution: 
   - Use content-based filtering for item cold start, 
   - use onboarding surveys or demographic-based predictions for new users, 
   - Use hybrid models that combine collaborative filtering with knowledge-based approaches.


2) Data Sparsity: Many users interact with only a small fraction of available items, leading to sparse matrices in collaborative filtering models.

=> follow up solution: 
   - Use matrix factorization techniques (SVD, ALS) to fill in missing data.


3) Popularity Bias: Highly popular items dominate recommendations, making it harder for niche content or new creators to get visibility.

=> follow up solution: 
 - Introduce fairness constraints in recommendation models. (in-processing: add to penalty fucntion, post-processing: reprocess the list so that it follow the user-defined constrained (e.g %percent of each group in ranking))

4) Filter Bubbles & Echo Chambers: (same as 3)


5) Fairness & Bias Issues: Models trained on historical engagement data may inherit societal biases (e.g., underrepresenting certain groups in job or content recommendations).
=> follow up solution:  check 3

6) Scalability & Real-Time Constraints: Large-scale recommendation systems (e.g., Twitter, Amazon) must process billions of interactions in real time.

=> follow up solution: use fast nearest neighbor search to speed up, use online ranking
