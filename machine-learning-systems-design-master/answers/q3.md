# Answer to question 3

**Question 3**

You run an e-commerce website. Sometimes, users want to buy an item that is no longer available. Build a recommendation system to suggest replacement items.

**Answer**






# I. Item side: based on items similarity  (Content-Based Filtering)



Data: 


- Item Metadata: Attributes like category, brand, price, size, color, etc.

- User-Item Interactions: Purchase history, clicks, views, cart additions, etc.
  ( if user has no historic data use data from similar users => use collaborative filtering, discussed next section)

- Inventory Data: Information about item availability.

- User Demographics: Age, gender, location, etc. (optional).





Model: Content-Based FilteringR (recommends items based on the features of the items and the user's past preferences)


- Find similarity btw items: get the list of top available items 
- Incorporate User Preferences: 
	- Use collaborative filtering to identify items similar users have purchased. (more details can be refered to next section )
	- Combine content-based and collaborative filtering scores.

Model Evaluation:

Use metrics like precision@K, recall@K, or NDCG (use matrix decomposition on implicit feedback to attain relevance score of items for each users) .

Real-time Recommendations: 


A/B Testing:

- A/B test the system with real users.

- Measure click-through rates (CTR) or conversion rates.


# II. User side: based on users' preferences 


Data: 


- Users' historical purchases, searches, and browsing behavior to understand their preferences.  => feature engineering
- Similar Users: cluster based on users features : 
	+ Demographic features
	+ Socioneconomic
	+ Behavior Patterns
- similar items: 
	

Model: Collaborative Filtering 
 + User-user: 
 + Item-Item 


=> each model 
 => query: 20 items 
           each item has features => predict relevance of items to users
