# Answer to question 5

**Question 5**

When you enter a search query on Google, youâ€™re shown a list of related searches. How would you generate a list of related searches for each query?

**Answer**
Multi-stage recommendation 
Eg: search CEO => return 10k list of relevance of queries

- what are those relevance items? 
- How are those relevance items are displayed?

Q1: what are those relevance items? => Retrieval step


1. Analyze Search Logs:  a data-driven method that leverages real user behavior to identify which queries are related.

Main idea: Leverage historical search logs to find cluster of search that are related to the query. For example, examine which queries are often submitted together or in succession. 

Steps: 
1a. To analyze query Co-occurrence: 
- Sequential Query Analysis: Queries that often appear consecutively or in the same session can be inferred to be related based on the assumption that users modify or expand their searches as they seek more specific information.

- Frequency Counts: Calculate how often pairs or groups of queries occur together. 

- Temporal Proximity:  Consider the time gap between successive queries.


1b. Apply statiscal and ML techniquese to enhance/expanse the list or refine them: 
- Association rules: Use data mining techniques such as association rule mining to discover common patterns
- Co-occurrence Matrices: Construct a matrix where each cell represents the frequency with which two queries appear together in the same session. 
- Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means or hierarchical clustering) to group similar queries together.
- Graph-Based Methods: Represent queries as nodes in a graph, where edges denote a co-occurrence relationship. 

1c.  Evaluation and Refinement
- 	Relevance Testing: Validate the related searches by comparing them against known relationships or by conducting user studies. 
-  Iterative Improvement

2. Compute Query Similarity (NLP based approach): (Early Ranker) 
Computing query similarity helps determine how closely related two search queries are based on their semantic meaning, word composition, and user interaction patterns.
- SOTA: Uses transformer-based models to capture contextual meanings.
Queries are embedded as a whole sentence rather than individual words.


=> Data set: (Query, list of items)
20 items: 20 x 100 where 100 is dimennsion of item features.

Q2: How are those relevance items are displayed? (Final Ranking)


(this question will discuss the step of  creating label and finalizing the results)

Ranking problem: 

Use implicit feedback data : relevant score of item to user query without user specifying it. It calculated base on user interactions and item features. (to create label)

- Eg: interact rate, # click, Dwell Time (Time Spent). Purchase or Conversion. Scroll Depth: How far a user scrolls down a page (useful for content-based recommendations).

user_query: user, big list of relevant itme to query (1 mils) => filter 1000 => rank all 1000 items using their relevance score  


implicit feedback data => attain relevance score =>  relavence score score as input to another decion making task (e.g: ranking problems ) -> obtain decision ->  measure decion quality loss (vary based on business needs)

Approach A: matrix decomposition (cheap but may not be accurate)
Approach B: small label set, ML prediction (cheap, but may be biased and will incur cost later)
approach C: assemble two lists (multiplier based on business questions)




POC: Approach A vs B:  e.g A does B: => implement it in the sytem
A/b Testing/ Monitoring:
